## Website description:
I enjoyed the PS4 game by the name of Bugsnax and wanted to share out a handy site to allow folks to track which bugsnax they were still missing, how to find them and what the locations/Grumpuses were. Sadly due to personal issues and technological issues, the project had to be brought down in scope.
